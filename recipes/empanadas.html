        <h3>Empanadas for the Cheese Lovers Out There</h3>
        <p>This is how I like to make my Empanadas. When I eat out, I usually encounter Empanadas with just cheese, just beef, or just chicken.
         So I figured...why not both? This recipe will make enough for 20 Empanadas</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Packs of La Fe Discos Para Empanadas</li>
            <li>32 oz Avocado Oil</li>
            <li>2 Pounds of Ground Beef</li>
            <li>1 Cup of Diced Onions</li>
            <li>3 Tb of Minced Garlic</li>
            <li>2 Tb of Sofrito</li>
            <li>8 0z Can of Tomato Sauce</li>
            <li>1 Tb of Garlic Powder</li>
            <li>1 Tb of Onion Powder</li>
            <li>1 Tsp of Cumin</li>
            <li>1 Tsp of Tumeric</li>
            <li>1 Tsp of Black Pepper</li>
            <li>2 Tb of Adobo</li>
            <li>1 Tb of Sazon</li>
            <li>1 cup of Pecorino-Romano Cheese</li>
            <li>4 cups of shredded cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Add about 1 Tbs of Avocado oil to a pan and set it to medium-low heat</li>
            <li>Once the oil is warm add in your 1 cup of diced onions and cook until browned</li>
            <li>Add in your 3 Tbs of Minced Garlic along with the 2 Tbs of Sofrito and allow it to simmer for 2-3 minutes</li>
            <li>Add in your 2 pounds of ground beef and begin to break apart until it is all separated</li>
            <li>Once it's separated, begin to add your Adobo, Garlic Powder, Onion Powder, Cumin, Tumeric, and Black Pepper</li>
            <li>Let it cook thoroughly on medium-low heat until it's all browned</li>
            <li>Once it's evenly cooked, add your Tomato Sauce, Sazon, and Pecorino-Romano Cheese</li>
            <li>Let your meat come to a simmer and then set it aside.</li>
            <li>You can now add your Avocado oil to a separate pan or pot (deep enough to fry the Empanadas at least one side at a time). I usually make sure I have about half an inch of oil in my cast iron pan</li>
            <li>We can now start to fill the Discs. Make sure you put your desired beef to cheese ratio into each disc. Put enough to fill when folded, but not too much to where we can't fold it or the disc tears when we're trying to fold</li>
            <li>After folding, we want to pinch the edges together and then press them with a fork on those edges on each side</li>
            <li>Once we do this to all our discs, we should be ready to fry them! I can usually only fit about 4 discs at a time in my pan, but if you can make room for more without overly crowding the pan, have at it!</li>
            <li>Fry on each side until golden brown and set aside onto a paper towel so that it can soak up any excess oil</li>
            <li>After frying all the discs, I usually like to let them cool for about 5-10 minutes and then dig in!</li>
        </ol>
