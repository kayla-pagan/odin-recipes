        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Boxes of Lasagna Noodles</li>
            <li>64 oz of Chicken Broth</li>
            <li>24 oz of Tomato Sauce</li>
            <li>2 Pounds of Ground Beef</li>
            <li>32 oz of Ricotta Cheese</li>
            <li>8 Cups of Shredded Cheese</li>
            <li>2 Tb Salted Butter</li>
            <li>1 Cup of Diced Onions</li>
            <li>3 Tb of Minced Garlic</li>
            <li>2 Tb of Sofrito</li>
            <li>1 Tb of Garlic Powder</li>
            <li>1 Tb of Onion Powder</li>
            <li>1 Tsp of Cumin</li>
            <li>1 Tsp of Tumeric</li>
            <li>1 Tsp of Black Pepper</li>
            <li>2 Tb of Adobo</li>
            <li>1 Tb of Sazon</li>
            <li>1 cup of Pecorino-Romano Cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Add your 2 Tbs of Butter and your 1 cup onions and allow them to brown over low heat</li>
            <li>Add in your 3 Tbs of Minced Garlic along with the 2 Tbs of Sofrito and allow it to simmer for 2-3 minutes</li>
            <li>Add in your 2 pounds of ground beef and begin to break apart until it is all separated</li>
            <li>Once it's separated, begin to add your Adobo, Garlic Powder, Onion Powder, Cumin, Tumeric, and Black Pepper</li>
            <li>Let it cook thoroughly on medium-low heat until it's all browned</li>
            <li>Once it's evenly cooked, add your Tomato Sauce, Sazon, and Pecorino-Romano Cheese</li>
            <li>The meat is pretty much done at this point. Set it aside and put your Chicken Broth to boil</li>
            <li>Add in your lasagna noodles once it's boiling and lower the heat to medium-high</li>
            <li>Once your noodles are done drain the broth and immediately rinse them with cool water to stop them from cooking any further</li>
            <li>Now we are ready to assemble the Lasanga. Take some excess sauce from the cooked meat and add it to the bottom of your dish. This will prevent the noodles on the bottom from sticking</li>
            <li>Then, you will add your first layer of Noodles making sure the entire surface is covered</li>
            <li>Spead a generous amount of Ricotta Cheese onto the entire layer of noodles you laid down</li>
            <li>Add a layer of your ground beef</li>
            <li>Sprinkle your shredded cheese on top of your ground beef layer</li>
            <li>Repeat steps 12-15 until you get to the top of your dish</li>
            <li>The last layer on the top will be Lasanga Noodles. You  will sprinkle this with a generous helping of shredded cheese</li>
            <li>Set your oven to 375 degrees and you will cook this for 40-50 minutes</li>
            <li>Let it cool for about 15 minutes and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
